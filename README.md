# 🚀 ISRO Launch Capability Analysis

A linear regression project analyzing payload trends across ISRO missions over four decades. This notebook explores how vehicle type, orbit selection, and mission year influence payload capacity.

## 📊 Highlights
- **Vehicle Evolution**: SLV → PSLV → GSLV → LVM3
- **Orbit Constraints**: GTO missions show reduced payload capacity, with increase in altitude payload decreses.
- **Model Performance**: R^2 score of 0.82 indicates strong correlation
